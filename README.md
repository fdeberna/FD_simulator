# Fire Department Simulator
 
This Python tool simulates the operations of a fire department in any city, real or not, by dispatching fire engines, ambulances, and other apparatus to the scene of incidents.

The output of the software is a table with the list of incidents occurred in the simulated time period. The structure of this table resembles real [Computer Aided Dispatch data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_dispatch). This table will contain information icluding the location of the incidents, how many units (e.g. fire engines and ambulances) responded to that incidents, the time when they were dispatched, the time it took for them to reach the scene, and more. 

# Goal

Fire departments could use this tool for planning and forecasting how any change in the number of fire stations, fire engine, ambulances, etc. would affect their operations. Multiple incidents occurring at the same time and requiring multiple units to respond in different parts of the city affect the efficiency of a fire department and its ability to maintain a coverage of the city in ways which are hard to predict. This software enables the advanced analysis needed to forecast response times performance, number of units busy responding at the same time at any given hour of the day, and many other metrics.
